                    <h1>Jayden Kyle</h1>
                    <h3>Multi-Media Student</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Jayden Kyle is a first-year student in the multimedia production program at Lethbridge College
                        focusing on Software development for applications. She started off at the University of
                        Lethbridge studying music and psychology because of her passion for music, which stemmed from
                        the fact that she played instruments ever since the fifth grade. She played flute for 4 years
                        and then switched to electric bass guitar for 4 years. During her time at the university, she
                        realised that her passion wasn't just for music but for creating. This led her to college to
                        pursue something more meaningful. During school, Jayden always strived to stay on the honour
                        roll even with extra circulars such as jazz and concert band, which led to the opportunity to
                        use the recording studios at the university as merely a high school student. In her free time,
                        she loves to create in any form of digital or physical media. She creates everything from music,
                        crocheting, sewing, woodworking, painting, and sculpting. Drawing, her favourite thing to do is
                        create. Ever since she was little, she has always been obsessed with figuring out how things are
                        made so she can make them herself. As a kid, it was hard to keep a toy together as she would
                        take it apart so that she could put it back together. As you can guess, as a kid, she wasn't
                        very successful at it, but at least she still enjoyed her broken toys.

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>Music has always been one of my greatest passions ever since I was a little girl. I love playing
                        music for others, performing music for others and experiencing music with others. I love to
                        collect instruments, you can never have too many. Music was the starting point for me, it helped
                        me fall in love with creating. I find it incredible how music feels simple but is
                        complicated.Music led to my fascination with audio tech which led to my fascination in
                        technology in general. Music is a huge part of who I am not because of the instruments I play
                        but because of the experiences it gave me.

                    <h3>Art For Others</h3>
                    <p>I've always thought that my passion for creating art for others comes from the fact that I am a
                        middle child who has always craved attention. I love the attention I get when I create art for
                        someone but what I love most is the satisfaction and sense of accomplishment I get when I see
                        someone else enjoying the thing I created. Creating art in general makes me feel like I can do
                        anything, like I'm unstoppable. If I can make art I can do anything.
